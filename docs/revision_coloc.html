See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made

<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Untracked files:
    Untracked:  analysis/revision_coloc.Rmd

Unstaged changes:
    Modified:   analysis/revision.Rmd

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not
included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to
have uncommitted changes.

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>For the pairs with ECT FDR &lt; 0.1, we performed colocalization
analysis on the supporting SNPs. We considered a ±250 kb window around
each SNP. Within this region, we conducted association tests for the
factor and the SNPs. Finally, we calculated the colocalization posterior
probability (PP4) using <code>coloc</code> package.</p>
