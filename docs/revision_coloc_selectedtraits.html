Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>For the pairs with ECT p-value &lt; 0.005, we performed
colocalization analysis on the supporting SNPs. We considered a ±250 kb
window around each SNP. Within this region, we conducted association
tests for the factor and the SNPs. Finally, we calculated the
colocalization posterior probability (PP4) using <code>coloc</code>
package.</p>
