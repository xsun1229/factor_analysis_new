We used data from GTEx whole blood tissue, it contains 670 samples for the gene expression data.

We applied cutoffs of 
+
- `supporting SNP ≥ 5` and 
- `gene number in pathway ≥ 20` 

to filter the pairs before performing FDR control. All results presented below are based on this setting.

Highlight: 

- Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis  and  LDL cholesterol 

ref: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0962892423001927

- Other O-glycan biosynthesis and LDL cholesterol

ref: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4067166/

The non-mucin O-glycans in this pathway include:

  - O-fucose glycosylation (e.g., NOTCH signaling)
  - O-mannose glycosylation (α-dystroglycan)
  - O-GlcNAc modification
  - O-linked glycans on LDLR and other lipoprotein receptors

These modifications directly affect:

  - LDLR stability
  - LDLR recycling
  - LDL particle clearance
  - Apolipoprotein glycosylation (ApoE, ApoC-III)

Changes in these O-glycans alter plasma LDL levels and cholesterol homeostasis.

## Examing some pairs 

### Oocyte meiosis > Red blood cell count

We extract the top 10 genes with highest loadings on the factor, and then examine their common functions (by ChatGPT)



| Gene        | Main Function                             | RBC Role Through This Function? | Explanation                                                                                                                  |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ADCY5**   | cAMP production, GPCR signaling           | **Possibly Yes**                | cAMP signaling modulates **EPO receptor signaling** and erythroid proliferation. Not RBC-specific, but pathway is relevant.  |
| **RBX1**    | E3 ubiquitin ligase component             | **Possible**                    | Ubiquitin–proteasome system controls erythroblast cell-cycle and apoptosis, but RBX1 is **general**, not erythroid-specific. |
| **PTTG2**   | Cell cycle / chromatid separation         | **Possible (weak)**             | Erythroblasts divide rapidly, so cell-cycle genes matter, but PTTG2 is **not known** to have an erythroid-specific role.     |
| **CCNE2**   | Cyclin E2, G1/S transition                | **Possible**                    | G1/S regulators are essential during early erythroid expansion, but CCNE2 is **general**, not RBC-specific.                  |
| **CDC16**   | APC/C subunit (mitosis control)           | **Possible (weak)**             | APC/C activity is required in all dividing cells; erythroblasts also rely on it, but CDC16 itself is **not RBC-enriched**.   |
| **ANAPC13** | APC/C assembly                            | **Possible (weak)**             | Same as CDC16—mitotic machinery required, but not specific to erythropoiesis.                                                |
| **CAMK2G**  | Ca²⁺-dependent kinase                     | **Unlikely**                    | Ca²⁺ signaling is important in many cells; erythropoiesis mainly depends on CaMKIIβ, not CAMK2G specifically.                |
| **MAPK13**  | p38 MAPK signaling (stress, inflammation) | **Possible**                    | p38 MAPK pathway regulates erythroid differentiation; MAPK13 is **p38δ**, which is less studied but may have minor roles.    |
| **SPDYA**   | Activates CDK1/2                          | **Possible**                    | CDKs are required for erythroblast cycling, but SPDYA is not a known erythroid regulator.                                    |
| **IGF1**    | Growth factor                             | **Strong Yes**                  | IGF1 **directly stimulates erythroid progenitor proliferation and survival** (BFU-E, CFU-E). Clear RBC biology.              |
