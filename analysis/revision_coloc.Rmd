# Introduction

For the pairs with ECT FDR < 0.1, we performed colocalization analysis on the supporting SNPs. We considered a Â±250 kb window around each SNP. Within this region, we conducted association tests for the factor and the SNPs. Finally, we calculated the colocalization posterior probability (PP4) using `coloc` package.


```{r}

supp_snp <- readRDS("/project/xinhe/xsun/pathway_factor/analysis/6.coloc/results/coloc_res_supp_snp.RDS")
supp_snp <- supp_snp[order(supp_snp$fdr_ect_pair, decreasing = F),]

DT::datatable(supp_snp,caption = htmltools::tags$caption( style = 'caption-side: left; text-align: left; color:black;  font-size:150% ;','Colocalization results for the supporting SNPs'),options = list(pageLength = 10) )

```
